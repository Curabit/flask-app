# Curabit's Server App

This is the server application that will be hosted on [app.curabit.in](https://app.curabit.in). It will be used to give a control interface to the therapist and to communicate with the VR application made in Unity.

## Feature Requests
For feature requests, please submit them as an issue with the "enhancements" label via the [issue tab](https://github.com/Curabit/flask-app/issues).

#### We would like to make this project open-source but maybe once after we've mastered project management ourselves?
